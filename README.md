ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alecia

I'm currently an Executive Virtual Assistant who offers Admin support, Pinterest & Social Media Management. 

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:
- Creating graphics in Canva and designing presentations
- Reading non-fiction books

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Data Analytics. I often work with figures and reports. So, I believe this would help in making me better at analyzing data and how to use it.
